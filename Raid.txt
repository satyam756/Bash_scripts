> RAID - Redundant Array of Independent Disks

> Type of RAID:

> RAID0 - data warehousing, 2 hard disks 5g + 5g = 10g, if one disk dies have data loose

> RAID1 - 5,5 = 5G, mirror of DISK1, if one disk dies data can be recoverd from other disk, it's slow due to replications.

> RAID5 - 5+5+5=12G, takes some storage to write the parity data, if any one of the disks failed data can still be retrived from other 2 disks.
